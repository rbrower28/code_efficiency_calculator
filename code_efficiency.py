""" This is the Code Efficiency Calculator.
Ever wonder how efficient your code really is?

This finds the amount of 'executable' lines of code in any python file.
Executable means every line that is essential to fulfill the purpose
of the program. This excludes:
- lines that start with #
- blank lines
- any line inside triple quotes (like this one!)

For example, all of these first few lines are non-executable!
Being comments, the computer doesnt actually run them, and the
code would be the same without!

For each file examined displays:
the total number of lines
number of lines that are executed when run
percent of lines run compared to the total
